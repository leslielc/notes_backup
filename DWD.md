AM CVn: 双白矮星演化结果 short period  (<1 hour) mass-transferring DWDs 

The *ultra-short* orbital periods of 10–65 minutes indicate that both the donor star and accretor star are [degenerate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter) or semi-degenerate objects 可能有accretion disk

When the orbital period has shrunk to about 5 minutes, the less-massive (and the larger) of the two white dwarfs will fill its [Roche lobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_lobe) and start mass transfer to its companion. Soon after the onset of mass transfer, the orbital evolution will reverse and the binary orbit will expand. It is in this phase, after the period minimum, that the binary is most likely to be observed

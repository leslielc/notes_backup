Precise positional information for standard sirens would enable precision measurements of cosmological parameters and offer new insights on structure formation; a high angular resolution gravitational wave observatory would allow the detection of a stochastic background and resolution of the anisotropies within it; it would also allow the study of accretion processes around black holes and could shed light on the origin of the diffuse neutrino background; and it would have tremendous potential for tests of modified gravity and the discovery of physics beyond the Standard Model.

 This concept of "[likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function)" is used today in the LIGO-Virgo analyses, and expresses the idea that the [residual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errors_and_residuals) – what you get after subtracting your model from the data – should be consistent with the properties of the noise.

 Fourier transforms are a way of converting a function of one variable into a function of a reciprocal variable—in the case of time you convert to frequency.

Fourier transforms encode all the information of the original function, so it is possible to convert back and forth as you like. Really, a Fourier transform is just another way of looking at the same function.

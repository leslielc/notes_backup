关于LISA noise估计

Noise estimation: This is part of the challenge. Sagnac is one of possibility, one can look at very low and very hugh freqs which is relatively free of GW sources. Or one can look at few-days long data without MBHB mergers

The noise is a complicated issue. We cannot switch off the GW sources. We are building a model based on partial information, auxiliary channels, etc



The null channel (Sagnac) reduces GW at low frequency so can be used to give some information

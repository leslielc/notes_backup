关于高阶harmonic提高质量上限 (https://journals.aps.org/prd/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.75.124002)

There is a caveat with regard to the use of higher harmonics that is worth mentioning: In the time domain the waveform should begin when **the highest harmonic reaches the lower cutoff**. This has an implication on data analysis as the templates will be an order of magnitude longer than before. Thus, it might be sensible to use higher harmonics only in the case of higher masses.

It is worth noting that the kth harmonic probes a **larger interval of the frequency domain** i.e. $k(F_{LSO} -   F_{in})$ relative to the fundamental harmonic. For brevity, we refer to this as the **span** of the kth harmonic.
